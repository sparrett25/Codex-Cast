🎣 Cast Visual Style Guide

A Codex Lumina Earthview Chamber

🎨 Palette (Earth-Toned Cosmic)

Base: Sepia parchment (#E7D9C6), Off-white ink paper (#F5F1E8)

Accents: River blue (#5C7D8A), Moss green (#6B7A49), Reed brown (#7A5C42)

Highlights: Muted gold (#C6A866), Charcoal ink (#1E1B18)

Shadows/Depth: Distressed dark umber (#3A2D22), Ink black (#0E0D0C)

Principle: Cosmic resonance through earthview tones. Nothing neon; everything grounded, textured, and organic.

✒️ Illustration Style

Technique: Ink-line caricature sketches with exaggerated features, shaded in sepia + muted earth tones.

Tone: Playful, mythic, slightly exaggerated but not grotesque.

Subjects:

Fish: Wanted posters + mugshots, “monster-like” caricatures.

Environments: Lakeshores, cattails, boats, trees — journal-like sketches.

Icons: Gear, bait, weather, maps — simplified ink stamps.

Consistency: All assets (fish, landscapes, UI accents) share the same hand-drawn caricature energy.

📜 Core Motifs

Wanted Posters: For each fish species (pre-catch, quest phase).

Mugshots: Auto-generated after a catch is logged, with details (date, bait, location).

Ledger Pages: Visual gallery of posters/mugshots as “Outlaw Roundup.”

Environment Panels: Caricature scenes (shoreline, reeds, river) behind or around content.

Glyph Overlays: Codex spirals drawn faintly as water ripples, sky reflections, or journal stamps.

🖼️ UI/UX Atmosphere

Backgrounds: Parchment textures, subtle paper creases, ink smudges.

Containers/Cards: Rounded, with distressed ink borders.

Typography:

Headers → Western poster fonts (bold, serif, distressed).

Body → Clean readable serif (journal style).

Interactions: Hover effects like faint ink blotches or ripples.

Navigation: Compact, scroll-aware navbar with earthy tones; icons drawn as caricatures.

🌌 Narrative Layer

Mirror Lake → Bestiary of “Wanted” fish posters.

Catch Journal → Mugshots of “captured outlaws.”

Environment & Map → Explorer’s field sketches.

Gear/Techniques → Illustrated icons (rods, lures, hooks) drawn like equipment entries in a mythic logbook.

✨ Essence:
Codex Lumina speaks in stars. Cast speaks in reeds and rivers. Both are mythic, but one looks up, the other looks across the water.
