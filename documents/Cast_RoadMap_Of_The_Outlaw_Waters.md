🎣 Cast: Roadmap of the Outlaw Waters
🌌 1. What Already Lives

Core Shell: Cast site is live and stable, with working chambers (Mirror Lake, Species, Gear, Techniques, Environment, Locations, Map, Journal).

Trip Planner: Integrated flow — date, species, forecast, and recommendations.

Mirror Lake: Houses the seed of the fish species library.

Ledger & Journal: Present as placeholders to hold records.

📜 2. New Vision Enhancements

Weaves narrative + style into what exists:

Caricature Style Identity

Fish as wanted posters (before catch).

Mugshots (after catch).

Backgrounds/environment (trees, lakes, cattails) in caricature sepia style.

Entire app unified in playful outlaw logbook aesthetic.

Ancient Story + Guide

Prologue: Legend of Mirror Lake.

Chapters: Each fish species introduced as mythic outlaws with lore + tactics.

Narrator: Tairo, fishing guide and spiritual companion, weaving story and lesson.

ElevenLabs voice integration for narrated playback.

Interactive Story Layer

Wanted Posters double as lore lessons + tactical guides.

Mugshots generated after catches → ledger of “outlaws captured.”

Catch Journal reframed as “Sheriff’s Ledger.”

Threshold Unlocks

First catch mugshot = user passes trial.

Unlocks Training Grounds: parchment map, interactive testing of gear/time/weather factors.

Future chapters + modules unlock as thresholds (rare catch, certain # of captures, etc.).

🌿 3. Roadmap Steps
Phase I — Visual Identity & Bestiary

Replace fish photo circles with caricature wanted posters.

Add mugshot generation when logging a catch.

Update backgrounds (Mirror Lake, Journal) with caricature sepia scenes.

Build a visual style guide into Cast repo (palette, fonts, textures).

Phase II — Narrative Integration

Seed Prologue of Mirror Lake (text + optional narration).

Add outlaw chapters for core species (Bass, Walleye, Catfish, Trout).

Place Tairo as guide avatar → text + voice toggle.

ElevenLabs integration for playback of Prologue + Chapters.

Phase III — Threshold & Training Grounds

Add catch logging flow → triggers mugshot generation + ledger entry.

After first mugshot → unlock Training Grounds chamber.

Build Training Grounds page (map + icons for gear, bait, time, weather).

Stub logic for probability engine (expand from Trip Planner rules).

Phase IV — Expansion

Add rare species/outlaws with advanced lore.

Add deeper probability engine for Training Grounds.

Add evolving environment backgrounds (time-of-day, weather).

Add progression system → advanced chapters unlock with thresholds.

🌟 4. Meaning

Not a new app → Cast remains the same living project.

Now a mythic logbook → playful, resonant, narrative-rich.

Learning Companion → fishing lessons become story, story becomes presence.

Codex Alignment → Cosmic Codex in the sky, Cast Codex on the waters.

🎣 Core Outlaws of Tampa Waters

Largemouth Bass – The Gaping Tyrant (freshwater lakes & rivers)

Tilapia – The Silent Invader (common, prolific, ever-present)

Catfish – The Whiskered Leviathan (ever-patient bottom dweller)

Redfish – The Copper Raider (inshore saltwater outlaw, strong fighter)

Snook – The Silver Ghost (sleek, elusive, prized by anglers)

🌿 Possible Local Additions (future chapters)

Tarpon – The Silver King (mythic challenge, legendary in Florida)

Speckled Trout (Spotted Seatrout) – The Speckled Trickster

Sheepshead – The Jailhouse Thief (striped, notorious bait-stealer)

Bluegill – The River Minions (small, many, ever-hungry)

🌀 Suggested Starting Path

Begin with 5 core outlaws: Bass, Tilapia, Catfish, Redfish, Snook.

Introduce Tarpon later as a rare “legendary outlaw” — a true chapter boss.

Expand with Speckled Trout + Sheepshead for flavor as Cast matures.

This gives us a balanced mix:

Freshwater staples (Bass, Tilapia, Catfish).

Inshore saltwater icons (Redfish, Snook).

Future legends (Tarpon, others).
